Professional Experience 


2015--PresentSenior Software EngineerOTC Intel RomaniaBucharest

    DSLTE Hybrid Access
        
            The project aims to create a bandwidth aggregation solution for DSL and LTE WAN access links. The solution is a packet-switched aggregation that benefits from custom MPTCP congestion control to deal with the very different link technologies
            The skill-set involved Linux TCP stack understanding, advanced performance tuning and debugging at both system and networking level.
            Part of the team that developed the project from POC to product state.
            Sustained a demo of the project at Mobile World Congress 2016 as part of the Intel Demo team
        




2013--2015Software EngineerOTC Intel Romania -- as a RINF Contingent WorkerBucharest

    AppMigrator
        
            Part of a 3 member team that designed and implemented a solution for migrating running applications between Android mobile devices. Applications were virtualized by means of linux-based containers. The migration was seamless not only in terms of downtime, but also in terms of network responsiveness.
            Based on the different types of applications, different live migration strategies were used (mainly a mix of post-copy and pre-copy migration) 
            Development areas include: virtualization, live-migration, KVM, Multipath TCP, kernel drivers, Qemu C++ development
            The project is part of a research EU FP7 Consortium with multiple industry and academia partners
            The project was awarded RD Project of the year 2016 by ANIS
        
    Multipath TCP
        
            Involved in testing and benchmarking the MPTCP open-source implementation from user-space point of view through applications like VM Migration Involved in patchwork for the existing opens-source implementation and setup of various test environments for MPTCP. A spinoff of this project was the integration of MPTCP for redundancy with an Openstack-controlled cluster deployment as a joined project Intel Cloud Platform Division.
        





    Android on ChromeOS
        
            Developed a POC of a running Android OS on ChromeOS platform by integrating Qemu with NativeClient. The end result is a way to have virtualized Android applications on ChromeOS. The POC was then later on handed to a product team for further development.
            The work resulted from the POC was accepted as a presentation at Intel OSTS 2014
          
    SGX enabling on Openstack
        
            Worked with the Intel SGX Romania division to allow the Openstack framework to take advantage of the Intel SGX extension
            My role involved configuring the Openstack framework in order to better fit an SGX-capable Virtual Machine
        




2011--2013CC++ DeveloperAxway RomaniaBucharest

    Project: Integrator: highly scalable, “any-to-any” and “many-to-many” transformation engine that offers full support for standard and non-standard document types, direct database read/write, and multiple input, target and reference files in a single transformation routine. Tasks included development, maintenance and continuous integration, remote support sessions on client production environment regarding functional and performance issues
    Project: B2BI: Business to Business Integration application that enables high data availability and consistency. Tasks included maintenance and optimization of a key core component of B2BI, as well as continuing to offer remote support for clients
    During this period I improved my debugging skills as a result of debugging real world distributed systems on product environments in time critical situations. 
    I have also increased my ability to internalize new tools and development systems.
